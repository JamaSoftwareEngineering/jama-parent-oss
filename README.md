# Public Parent Project (OSS)

The `jama-parent-oss` is a public parent project that is meant to prescribe a small number of best practices for (Maven)
builds.

It should not contain the world, since that would be useless for most projects. It should also not contain a lot of
dependency management, since that's more up to child projects (think composition).

It should also not contain anything proprietary to Jama, there is a jama-parent for that which has stuff like references
to Jama's internal Maven repository, and different copyright notices, and you won't find in the open source space.

Things to expect here:

 - Meta data
 - License information
 - Source encoding
 - Plugin management
 - Default compiler level
 - Configuration of meta data in manifests (JAR, WAR)
 - Determining build number (Git ref, etc.)
 - Sorting POM files
 
There's nothing earth-shattering in `jama-parent-oss`. We are merely open sourcing this to be able to open source other
project, that were traditionally dependent on a similar but internal POM file (`jama-parent`) that contains some
internal references.
